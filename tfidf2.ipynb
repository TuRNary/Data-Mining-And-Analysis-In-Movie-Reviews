I'd lean more towards the second option, because Ant-Man and the Wasp is entertaining as hell, even if it does trip at some points.\", '5 Bagger, it had Tim!

The film does not develop its antagonist well. The duo of protagonists shines in their respective roles. Now let\\'s go to the grand post-credit scene, so here comes Spoiler. In the scene, we see Hank Pim, the Wasp and Pim\\'s wife being wiped out by the \"snap\" while Scott Lang is trapped in the quantum realm, where it is reflected in the main events of \"Avengers: Endgame\". I don\\'t know about you but I think the post-credits scene from \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is the best scene in the feature', 'Captures the same tone of the first movie.

The first \"Ant-Man\" from 2015 is much better than this film in my opinion.', \"Reasonably entertaining, but negligible MCU film. You can't help but feel this just something to pass the time between the consequential storyline of Infinity War and Endgame, but Paul Rudd is great as always\", \"okay, another 'got problem, use action, problem solved' movie that can't be more forgettable.\", \"Don't understand the hate towards this movie, the only thing I hated about it was the fact how Quicksilver died... But loved the introduction to Wanda and Vision!\", \"Despite great action and character moments, Age of Ultron fails disappoints due to an uneven tone and a villain that's hardly menacing.\", \"The weakest of all The Avengers movies, Age of Ultron gets too bogged down in setting up story lines for the future instead of focusing on making itself the best movie it can be. In particular, the titular villain, Ultron, feels like a missed opportunity for what could have been a very memorable antagonist. Still, there is enough of Marvel's trademark humor, action, and strong characterization to keep you entertained through its nearly 2-and-a-half hour runtime.\", 'Only Weldon can screw up the 2nd greatest Marvel villain.', \"Yeah sure WandaVision made this movie better but it's my favourite avengers movie period\", \"Horrible in almost every turn... didn't like it at all, except for the Ironman v Hulk scene. It's a waste of time...\", \"Loved the first Avengers but this just didn't gel with me. Ultron wasn't menacing in any way and was just evil for the sake of the story.

Marvel ruins yet another villain by making him spew joke after joke. Heroes destroy and cause death and destruction but at the end of the days it's just jokes after jokes. The worst of the avengers movies.\", 'A very enjoyable Marvel movie, I think anyone would enjoy it both audibly and visually. 8.5/10', 'Overhyped, cookie cutter Marvel movie so it is good for passing time. The last fight scene was pure CGI and made it anti-climatic. The villain and hero were great but it was everything else that was either mediocre(last fight scene) or annoying(the sister). Critics praised it for being a black led super hero, guess they forgot about all the ones that came before. If you want a really good black super hero movie try Blade.', \"Overrated. Black Panther is more interesting in Civil War and is overshadowed by literally everyone in the film. The new suit does not make sense. Very simple and predictable plot. Wakanda's perspective did not make sense in the first place, which does not make Killmonger a good villain but Wakanda less relatable. The worst CGI in the MCU; however, by far the best soundtrack.\", \"I don't get how in the world this can be the top 3 movie in RT. It was fun but that's it. Mediocre movie that leveraged the political situation.\", \"With Chadwick Boseman playing his role to perfection, strong supporting cast, some really good action but most importantly has a moral to the story that it told perfectly. This is easily the best standalone movie in the MCU. Not only is it a fantastic superhero movie but it's just a fantastic movie in general.\", \"A new and interesting story that personally wasn't for me. I can get the appeal thought and I liked the action and story of the movie overall.\", '#17/25 Best Moment: Villain and Worldbuilding', 'Wakanda Forever. We Love You 3,000 Chadwick Boseman!', \"Black Panther is a great film with a lot of emotion and heart. The story is the main focus of the film, and it shines throughout the whole movie. As much as I liked the story, I do think that it was a bit off. The writing was good, and there were a lot of solid aspects of the film. Yet, I still felt like the film needed more. There were a lot of aspects of the film that felt unexplained. For example, the tribe system in Wakanda seemed a bit confusing. Some additional exposition that showed how the tribe system works in Wakanda would have made the movie a lot stronger. There was also a lack of balance in the different parts of the film. The three main aspects of this film, the action, the story, and the message, were not equally balanced in the overall product. I felt that while the message of the film was great, it took over the other two aspects at times. This problem created some pacing issues as some sequences dragged on for way too long, leaving some parts of the film to lose momentum. The film desperately needed another big action scene and more explanation in the story department. What was already in the film was solid, but the movie just needed to be elevated to a higher place. The technical aspects of the film were also a mixed bag. The cinematography was visually pleasing, and I thought a lot of the movie looked very beautifully shot. What didn't look great was the VFX and CGI. There were some solid visual effects at some points, but then some looked awful. The CG characters looked very wonky at times. The T'Challa and Killmonger battle sequence was just a CG mess. The score, on the other hand, was very nicely done. It felt cohesive throughout the whole film and made it sound unique and special for this film. The production and set design were also quite nice as Wakanda looked stunning. The editing was also pretty solid, but it felt a bit jarring at times. The cast was the highlight of the film as there were so many actors who did such a great job. Chadwick Boseman did an outstanding job as T'Challa and made him such a strong, emotional character. There was never a dull moment from Boseman. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira also did very well in their respective roles as they brought some dynamics to the film that were needed in the overall story. Someone I did not care for was Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. Something about Jordan's performance felt so off. It is like Jordan didn't even try to make his character have multiple emotions. The rest of the supporting cast was great, and it seemed like they were having tons of fun making this film. Overall, Black Panther is a film that just needed some upgrades in some departments. There were very few scenes where I was wowed with what was on screen. The film needed to get some better VFX and CGI in addition to some slight script upgrades that would have translated to a better-paced film. However, with a great score and a solid cast, Black Panther does make for an entertaining film. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com\", 'Immensely dull. I was very disappointed after all the hype.', 'A great sequel! This movie had a lot to live up to, and James Gunn and everyone at marvel done a great job. I loved this movie. It gave more characters chances to shine, especially Yondu. The soundtrack is amazing once again. They used the song \"The Chain\" by Fleetwood Mac to great use. The cast is great once again. Baby Groot is adorable and perfect. Great ending. The colours in this movie are breathtaking. It\\'s a very pretty movie to look at. Great summer popcorn blockbuster.', 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 is a fun installment in the MCU that helps to set up INFINITY WAR!', 'Chris Pratt is annoying. His face, his voice, his personality is aggravating and annoying. I hate his character and everything about him. Other than that, every OTHER character and everything about them and this story is straight up awesome. Anything to do with Chris Pratt though is ridiculous. His characters demi god storyline with Kurt Russel is cringe to watch acted out. Every supporting cast actor brought more fun to the show than the main character so its worth a watch.', 'A rare gem of a movie indeed, as the action was intense, the humour left me in stitches, and the character interaction and growth were done perfectly. Russell and Stallone were great as usual but it was Rooker that easily stole the thunder from the respective actors.', 'This is just an awful movie', \"In an adventure that involves the public with action and comedy, Guardians of The Galaxy vol. 2 ends up becoming better than the first because of one reason: the great development of his characters. Peter Quill's achievement in getting the father he always wanted and then discovering that he killed his mother. The delving into the delicately exciting story of Gamora and Nebula. The friendship and identification between Rocky and Yondu. Drax's evolution, both in losing his loved ones and opening his heart to Mantis. And Groot's new face. James Gunn manages to particularly enjoy and develop each of his characters and bring them together as a family.\", 'While adding more interesting characters, a lot more heart and twist help create a great story that continues what we loved about the first film. But loses it touch in some places and diverts in ways which help grow the banta from characters, but also losses sight of what make the first original.', \"Guardians 2 brings a breath of fresh air from the vast MCU. It brings a new comedic and family dynamic to the franchise that hasn't been seen ever. James Gunn's new movie provides lots of fun, action, and drama as the story progresses. It also ties up a lot of loose ends from the first movie. Overall, it is a good movie to watch for hard MCU fans and an overall good movie for the casual movie watcher.\", 'This movie exceeded my expectations, I absolutely love this Spider-Man movie. It was better than Homecoming and FFH, which I believe were the most mediocre Spider-Man movies. This movie gave us an excellent story for the hero. It felt more mature and that\\'s a good thing, the closest we got to live action sinister six and excellent casting for the characters. This is a must watch for Spider-Man fans. Only cons was the bad pacing in the first half and questionable dialogue like, \"Scooby-doo this crap\" which was awful but everything else was funny and fun. This felt like a true Spider-Man film on par with Spider-Man 2 and the animated spider verse movies.', 'Not perfect, but its the kind of movie that sets another franchise, so...', 'Wow just wow! Almost the perfect movie!', \"The genre of superhero movies is not dead, even if Disney has been doing their all to ruin it with woke politics. Fortunately Sony has come to rescue with this sublime blend of nostalgic characters and exploration of central Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility. Transcending history and the world, a tale of souls and spiders, eternally retold, this time in triplicate. What a wild ride! Character motivations were laid out in great depth with simple strokes, which made the battles so much more interesting; each villain had understandable, rational goals, and they were fighting for their lives for once instead of merely power, madness, or destruction of Spider-Man. Benedict Cumberpatch really nails Dr. Strange (once again), and the impudent humor strikes a great tone for the events. I have always had a soft spot for Doc Ock (since 1980 when I started reading Spider-Man comics), and it was such a treat to see Molina retread the role with great aplomb. Willem Dafoe was again an incredible Norman Osborne and Green Goblin: I've always had such a burning hatred for the character, and he did not defuse it at all, since his madness still ruins everything he touches. His fate simply underscored Peter Parker's ability for forgiveness, even if it were unearned and given at such great cost. Venom is such waste of space that the end clip did not do anything to me. Madness or being mastered by an alien parasite does not interesting characters make.\", 'This movie just didnt live up to its predecessors. The humor timing was off most of the time and there was no chemistry between spidey and his girl.', \"Best spiderman movie so far. You can get the comedy, drama, and action in one package. It's great how they made it bitter sweet ending.\", \"Whilst the film was alright I personally believe it fell flat on it's face as the producers decided to cast relatively unknown actors as extremely obscure villains, I believe that if they chose to cast the brilliant Jared Leto as Morbius and make the film about him rather than some furry with spider powers the film would've been so much better\", \"A part of me wishes we had got a new villain from Spidey's vast rogues gallery (we haven't seen Scorpion on the big screen yet) but there's no arguing with the massive nostalgia machine that is this movie. All the actors here are on point and the chemistry between the three Spider-Men is awesome. I could have watched them just rehash their movies for hours. As many have said, Andrew Garfield particularly steals the show, bringing the heart and the humor to the Web Head that made many of us fall in love with him in the first place.\", 'A great final summation of decades of spidermen with some heartfelt moments and moments of nostalgia.', \"Today I'm going to talk about Marvel's latest effort, the latest film from the MCU Spiderman: No Way Home, for the direction of John Watts. This film was a mediatic phenomenon, as we all know, there were high expectations and have been made a lot of assumptions by Marvel fans and not only. I think this hype is good for cinema in general but a terrible film like this isn't worth for all this hype, the others lose something because everyone have been to the cinema only for a film that I don't feel like call as such. The direction seems not to exist and unfortunately, I'm not kidding, everything is made by the computer and you don't understand anything. There isn't photography or cinematography, anything, not even a shot that you could remind, nothing remains in mind except the thought about the money you have spent for buying a ticket and watching this total idiocy. The previable plot has a lot of plot twist that do not add anything to the plot which is predictable, like the 90% of the events, so the story is a total idiocy. It seems like the people who written this film, which is not a real film, did not have any ideas and invented a mess for end in something obvious. The concept in the beginning is useless, so if I want to remove what is useless this film would last for like 15 mins. The screenwriting isn't decent, to add, with a lot of mandatory rules broken with narrative elements that are equal to all and not innovative, and all this fix me a question in mind: How did they write this film? The principal character are: Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and the ones from the old Spiderman's films. Tom Holland's Spiderman isn't interesting because is like a dumb boy with stupid ideas that don't make sense, he wants to be a hero but he is incapable, it comes out badly. He is kid that acts in an unwatchable way, in fact he has two expressions; one when he's happy and the other one when he is sad, when he cries, he is ridicules and not credible. In conclusion his acting was cringe. Moreover, this Doctor Strange of Benedict Cumberbatch is like a child in fact he has behaviors truly questionable; he is stupid and the symbol of the terrible fanservice, he made thing that the old Doctor Strange would never do, he can't even do spells in the right way, c'mon. So, for resume everything in one word, he is an idiot. Thanks, this film, they demonstrated that the actors of the Sam Raimi's trilogy are the best, because they are such great actors and they work perfectly, from fantastic William Dafoe's Goblin to wonderful Otto Octavius of Alfred Molina. When I think that I spent my time in 2 hours and 30 min of vision, which are super long, for this terrible film, I feel sick, I wasted my time and everyone who watched it, because there isn't something new, it isn't cinema, only a product of marketing, only for sell tickets and so and so forth. Having seen this film, I'm really scared for upcoming new MCU movies, if this is the type there will be in the future I recommend Marvel to do a pleasure for itself and everyone else and close the doors and say goodbye to everyone. In conclusion, with all the hype there was for this terrible film, they could done it better, and it didn't take much in hindsight. They must not have the objective of satisfying the fans but only do something new that could be called entertainment and not repugnance in the vision, something that could not be called only fanservice but also cinema.\", 'There are some inconsistencies.Overall pretty enjoyable.', 'It was a little slow paced at times, but overall I liked it! Good back story, loved the historical retconing. Happy to have gotten an intro to these characters', \"I watched this move two months ago with my friends, and it was one of the worst movie experiences I have had. Let's forget about the fact that I actually went to the theatre to watch James Bond, but ended up watching this due to a filled theatre, i digress. The Eternals isn't like any other Marvel movies, it has to introduce us to its relatively new characters to an audience that isn't so familiar with its comic book, this already huge task isn't helped by the sheer amount of unnecessary characters it introduces. It is bloated with many characters, just for the purpose of trying to have as many people relate with the diverse cast. It's story telling is even worse, it undoes any progress it developed with it's character in the end, and it also has to justify the characters not interfering with Thanos, it develops a main villain who is supposedly meant to be ominous and feared, only to have him get killed by one of the side characters in a matter of minutes, it also doesn't have a focused story line and hopes we will get over it because of the diversity and the famous characters it introduces. In short the movie is a mess, to me it is the pinnacle of directors trying to add diversity and equity without developing the characters, and even then the movie had a lot of space to make the story line good enough, which it didn't do. This has to be one of the worst movies I have watched in my life.\", ') Should of had actual Marvel fans review this movie before it was released. Eternals wished they were as relatable as The Avengers. I actually started to sleep during this movie. My kids lost interest and actually went in the other room to watch real Marvel movies.

The plot pretty much follows the current Marvel formula without much by way of character arch. Shang Chi, Katy, Xialing and the rest are pretty much the same characters by show's end as they were in the beginning. They also bare a striking resemblance to the character archetypes now seen in every Marvel film since Guardians of the Galaxy. It's fun. It's entertaining. It's not great or particularly interesting. Shang Chi is a wonderful Marvel IP, let's hope the already-planned sequel with this character shows a little less MCU repetition and a little more originality.\", 'A must watch movie! Although I do love Marvel, this movie did not follow the stereotypical villain and hero storyline. This movie had a very complex villain that made you feel some sort of sympathy for them. Also incorporated the beauty of the Asian culture. Great Ending and Overall Beautiful and Humor filled movie!', \"This is the most middle-of-the-road movie I've ever seen. For each thing this movie does well, it does another poorly. For each thing this movie does amazingly, there's a flop to match it. First off is the good: the characters in this movie are very likable. Each one feels understandable and relatable to a degree. All the characters have strengths and weaknesses to overcome. There aren't any Captain Marvel type characters who have no weaknesses. Even the villain of this story feels relatable and understandable. I could sympathize with his reasons for doing what he does. The combat in this movie is fantastic. I loved watching the fight scenes in this movie. If you're into that, you're going to have a fun time. The story is fresh and interesting. I'm pretty unfamiliar with Chinese culture and traditions, and I enjoyed seeing how this was incorporated into the movie. It doesn't feel heavy-handed or preachy. Now for the bad: the dialogue is trash. So many of the lines are laughably bad. The beginning of this movie is the worst offender. So many of the lines feel like they were written by a robot who is trying to prove they aren't a robot. The CGI is so bad in some areas. Clearly, the CGI budget went to the big fight in the end, but the bus scene at the beginning looks so fake. I understand Disney knew this wasn't going to be a $1 billion+ box office movie, so they had to save money, but it looked amateurish in some areas. For a movie belonging to a franchise that's been around for almost 14 years, it could have been a lot better. Finally, the connections to the larger MCU as a whole felt a little weird. There's some mention to the snap and Iron Man, and there's a larger connection to Dr. Strange, but I had so many questions about how this connected to the universe. Why weren't the 10 rings used against Thanos? Did the Avengers not know he existed? You'd think someone would have known this man with immortality exists somewhere. Where was he? It felt like there was a lot of oversight in this department. Marvel, if you want me to care about your new additions in a post-Endgame MCU, you're going to have to do a lot better than that.\", 'Perfection, absolute perfection.', \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a good film and I'm glad I watched it. But is it good enough for me to recommend you go to the cinema and risk contracting a deadly virus during a pandemic? No, not really. But then again, what is? Let me start by saying that this film's cast is remarkable. Not just because it's an Asian American all-star cast in Hollywood blockbuster but also because there's not a single bad performance among them. Our duo leads, Shaun, aka. Shang-Chi, (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina), have a delightful chemistry between them from the moment we step into their San Francisco lives, though the limelight is quickly snatched by Shaun's sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) who instantly became my favourite among our main characters. Shaun is a likeable lead but his story also suffers from being very formulaic. His mother is dead, his mourning father trained him to be a deadly weapon, he thought he could escape his father's ambitions but now he must face and overcome them. It's stuff we've seen and heard before and while it's stuff that works, it keeps Shang-Chi from truly establishing much of a unique identity. The same goes for the film's antagonist, Shaun's father Wenwu (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) who in typical Marvel fashion is slowly turned from an interesting character with depth to his actions to the typical evil super villain once we reach the final act - though he still manages to have a strong presence throughout the film's 2 hour runtime. As for the story itself, I'm not the right person to say how well it portrays the various aspects of Chinese mythology, but nothing struck me as particularly different from what I have come to expect from American productions with a Chinese motif. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as I'm quite fond of the mythological aspects depicted in Shang-Chi, but it does prevent it from standing out in that regard. However, where the film does stand out is during its action set-pieces. There's a natural flow to the fight scenes that is often missing in other superhero films which I believe can be attributed in great part to the work of stunt coordinator Brad Allan and the (sadly unnamed) Chinese choreographers that director Destin Daniel Cretton reportedly brought on to deliver on the film's wuxia-inspired combat sequences. In particular, there's a fight scene early in the film that takes place on a moving bus which really stood out for me because of how great it looked and felt despite it technically being smaller than most other superhero battles we've come to expect. Though sadly, even this aspect of Shang-Chi succumbs to formula by the final act where the action devolves into a computer-generated effects soup - and not the fun and exciting kind. I realize that I sound very down on this film, but it's only because Shang-Chi's strengths are so strong that the moments of weakness or blandness disappoint me greatly. I do believe it's a really charming film with a lot of heart and glorious performances. It's fast, full of fun action and serves as a landmark achievement for bringing Asian Americans into focus within the world's biggest movie franchise. It just doesn't quite stick the landing, and that's a shame, because when it's in the air it's soaring.\", 'It seems as though the writers took the cultural implications of the film and used it as an excuse to make a boring and lackluster film, really hoped for more from the \"Asian MCU film\".', 'Amazing acting, great story!

The film could probably be trimmed down to an hour and twenty minutes and nothing would be lost. Luckily for the film though all the other characters around Carol keep this movie afloat, and are the best parts of this movie, especially the main villain Talos.

Director Alan Taylor's superhero romantic fantasy thriller Thor: The Dark World (2013) is often maligned as Marvel's worst movie, but I found it enjoyable when I first saw it as well as after revisiting it now. Alan Taylor's direction is gripping, balancing strange fantasy elements like dark elves, silly comedy with Kat Dennings' blunt intern Darcy, and sweet romance drama between Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige entrusted Thor to Alan Taylor, who takes Chris Hemsworth's Norse god Thor into a tender romantic hero and quirky fun loving guy. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is not the celestial deity from Thor or The Avengers, but Hemsworth's Thor is still endearing and cool. Hemsworth's naturally funny charisma, buff physique, likable easy going personality, intense screen presence, and striking romantic charm all work in his favor as The God of Thunder Thor. Writers Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne, and Christopher L. Yost curiously dive into mythology to make Thor's new villains dark elves. The dark elves are neat folklore figures with dark imagery and atmosphere. However, Christopher Eccleston's creepy and commanding Malekith is not the most interesting Marvel antagonist either. I found the voluptuous Kat Dennings' Darcy a chipper source of comedy relief. Everything Dennings says as Darcy is hilarious to me. She's so dumb funny. Thor and Jane's tender romance feels authentic and heartwarming again with their cute rapport emotionally working on me again like in Kenneth Branagh's Thor. The fierce rivalry and brotherly bond between Thor and Loki is explored to a genuinely moving finale where loyalties and motivations are tested. There are actual character arcs in Thor: The Dark World. Natalie Portman is lovely and intelligent as scientist Jane Foster once again. I think her romantic chemistry with Chris Hemsworth really adds a lot of warmth and heart to Thor's Marvel movies. Tom Hiddleston's trickster god Loki is always funny, sly, and emotionally resonant. Anthony Hopkins has that peerless gravitas as Odin Allfather with Hopkins giving hard glares and stalwart emotional clarity in every one of his lines. Jaimie Alexander is so pretty and cool as Lady Sif. I wish Marvel had given her more action sequences and deeper characterization as Jaimie Alexander is an amazing actress. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson, and Tadanobu Asano are still exciting and funny as Thor's brothers in arms. Idris Elba's steadfast and solemn Heimdall and Rene Russo's moving mother of Thor named Frigga are fantastic like in Thor. Stellan Skarsgård is very funny and likable as Erik Selvig once again. Alice Krige is sincerely eerie as Eir. Chris O'Dowd gets cucked by Chris Hemsworth's masculinity in his love for Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Stan Lee's cameo is as charming as his other appearances in Marvel's movies. Chris Evans and Benicio del Toro's cameos are really neat and fun. Editors Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith's steady cuts keep Thor: The Dark World moving right along for an easy going fantasy adventure that does not drag too much in 112 minutes. Cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau uses these lovely ultra wide shots for the fantasy dark elves sequences, but as usual for me, I prefer the sleek and intimate close-up shots of Thor, Jane, Darcy, or Loki that are more emotionally revealing. John Bush's set decoration feels natural for Selvig's lab equipment, and grand for Asgard's golden realm of the gods. Art directors Julian Ashby, Mike Stallion, Ray Chan, Thomas Brown, Jordan Crockett, Mark Swain, Matthew Robinson, Hayley Easton Street, and Adriaan Engelbrecht craft a grim fantasy realm for the dark elves. I wish we got to see more of their bleak world as visual effects artists James Baker, Mike Stillwell, and Adrien Flanquart's CGI is impressive for the black shroud of magic infesting Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Composer Brian Tyler wrote a beautiful, melodic score for Thor: The Dark World. His symphony captures the brooding nightshade of the dark elves, gentle romantic feelings for Thor and Jane, as well as a touching melody of Loki's fateful choice. Costume designers Wendy Partridge, Ken Crouch, Alejandro M. Hernandez, Gia Jimenez, Jacqueline Shulman, Nigel Hyams, Kim Shek, Kurt J. Blackwell, and Jason Airey come up with neat outfits for everyone. I do wish there was more color to these costumes and more saturation in general in The MCU. The make-up crew did amazing work for the dark elves and main cast making everyone look amazing. In short, Thor: The Dark World is slightly underrated and very entertaining. It's solidly in the middle of Marvel's movies for me, not near the bottom.\", \"No, I'm sorry, I can't with this movie. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's the worst in the MCU. It misses everything they built up in Thor. The character is still good, but the story there is no saving it. A villain with no personality, no reason to be, bland. I also think it's a big mistake that they gave so much attention to Darcy and the other supporting characters. Yes, sometimes they can be a good comic relief, but here they overdo it. Loki dying again but not really, it already feels too forced. I think many will agree with me that they don't even remember half the movie. The only important thing is the reality gem which isn't even a gem to begin with.\", 'One of my least favorite MCU films. I love Kat Dennings, though.', 'Not so bad as some say.', 'The movie was okay. Malekith was a weak villain though.', \"For me personal Thor and Loki are one of the best duo's to watch in the MCU. In this movie again the chemistry between them was great, but the story lacked some logic. For me this movie is a bit of an overkill. Thor and Loki still make it enjoyable to watch.\", \"It's not as bad as peopel say but it still has some problems. I had a great time with this movie and that is what matters.\", 'El evolución del personaje de Loki (Tom Hiddleston) me parece lo mejor de la película. Tiene diálogos mas animados con buen sentido del humor. Las \"batalla final\" tiene un buen plot twist.', 'Not the dumpster fire people make it out to be. Entertaining enough to keep you watching.', \"Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, is another one of those MCU films where it's take it or leave it; If you enjoy Thor, and the different worlds aspect, you will enjoy this film, if you don't particularly care for it, you're most likely not going to like this film. I always try to give the Thor films the benefit of the doubt, due to it's hard to sculpt premise, but The Dark World wasn't one of those films that needed to be made. Even though Alan Taylor handled most of the aspects better than the first Thor, while somewhat keeping the continuity alive, The Dark World is just utterly forgettable, and almost disposable. Taylor set up a few decent expositions, but due to the fast pace, nothing carried through, becoming underdeveloped, and thrown away, with the tones being here, there, and everywhere. Taylor did his best by trying to give everyone more to do, but everyone was just so bland! Our returning protagonist do the best with what they're given, but all of the side characters, especially the human side characters, are just throw away. The creative team spent no time building anyone up besides our three leads in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tom Hiddleston. Chris Hemsworth returns once again as Thor, but there wasn't much added to his character. The writers spent too much time on trying to force the relationship between him and Natalie Portman, that ended up diminishing some of Thor's best qualities, to a certain extent. On the flip side, his relationship with Loki is captured great, being the best parts of the film. I wish I could say that Hemsworth carried the film, but he, himself said that he wasn't too crazy on it. Natalie Portman returns as Jane, just to take up time and space. The writers tried to make her a key piece to the narrative, but it did not pay off at all. I feel bad for Portman, because she's a very good actress; she just can't catch a break with these writers, writting her character. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he is questionably sidelined for most of the first half of the film, not having much to do at all. Even though I wasn't fond of him being put off to the side for the majority of the film, the writers gave him a nice grounded side to his character, while making a great impact to the film. The biggest issue I had with Malekith is, if you're going to have a great villain like Loki in the film before, you need to at least match the power, or out-do him, and Malekith is a flat out, laughable villain. His super underdeveloped motive is tremendously outplayed already. Christopher Eccleston tries way too hard to be a good villain, but he poses such a small threat, while just not fitting the scheme for Thor, or the MCU at that. Kurse on the other hand, definitely had the potential to be a decent villain, that poses and actual threat, but he was nothing but a disposable side character. The screenplay by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne & Christopher Yost, was the biggest downfall of the film. Most of their dialogue and jokes were forceful and bland, while they couldn't seem to find a tone to stick to. One of the best aspects of the film, was the action, backed up by the film wonderful effects. Out of all of the films so far, besides Marvel's: The Avengers, the action has been there, but not one of the highest points of the films; here, it's one of the main focuses, paying off pretty well by cutting down some dialogue scenes that could've been created. Overall, I came in HATING this film, but left somewhat enjoying it, and now seeing it just SLIGHTLY better than the first.\", 'Not as good a plot, or having as strong of a director as the original. The cast is still great the action inventive and the characters are still a blast.', 'Good in parts, but the main plot feels rushed when it actually arrives and the visuals are surprisingly unimpressive', \"You have a decent time watching it but you'll forget everything in 2 days\", 'Tom Hiddleston good, Chris Hemsworth good, wonderful soundtrack, film: horrible, rotten, bad, horrible and disgusting.', \"It passed my time. That's about it. The villain was too forgettable and the storyline had way too many convenient scenes. I think, that Loki is one of the few things, that hold this movie together. Thor is really interesting. I love Chris Hemsworth, and his Thor. He always gives a great performance. Malekith was far too underdeveloped. The Infinity Stone was not as well explained or developed.

The friendship and identification between Rocky and Yondu. Drax's evolution, both in losing his loved ones and opening his heart to Mantis. And Groot's new face. James Gunn manages to particularly enjoy and develop each of his characters and bring them together as a family.\", 'While adding more interesting characters, a lot more heart and twist help create a great story that continues what we loved about the first film. But loses it touch in some places and diverts in ways which help grow the banta from characters, but also losses sight of what make the first original.', \"Guardians 2 brings a breath of fresh air from the vast MCU. It brings a new comedic and family dynamic to the franchise that hasn't been seen ever. James Gunn's new movie provides lots of fun, action, and drama as the story progresses. It also ties up a lot of loose ends from the first movie. Overall, it is a good movie to watch for hard MCU fans and an overall good movie for the casual movie watcher.\", 'Not much character development. Should have been a Disney+ show.']\n"
