Because there's so many characters, it can be awhile before we check in on a character we had earlier in the movie. That's not necessarily an issue in itself, but sometimes their actions are forgettable, so you have to remind yourself what they're even doing. There's a big focus on the Guardians of the Galaxy which I like, but they definitely get a lot of screen time compared to other Avenger veterans. Tom Holland and RDJ have great chemistry. Their characters work very well together. CGI can he kind of hit or miss depending on the scene.

It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen. Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it. However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view. Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox\", 'Feb 24, 2022', 5.0], ['Gustavo F', \"I'm waiting anxiously to a Marvel movie that will make me say ''Damn, this was better than Infinity War''\", 'Feb 22, 2022', 5.0], ['Gage W', 'This movie shows what patience and long build-ups can produce, which is the coalescence of all these characters you know and love battling it out against the biggest threat yet.', 'Feb 17, 2022', 5.0], ['Don S', 'A cinematic masterpiece.', 'Feb 13, 2022', 5.0], ['Dustin D', \"Disney's Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is about an infinite number of superheros fighting the halfway-existential threat of Thanos. The movie is even more bloated than the previous two Avengers films, but surprisingly holds together. Thanos is the most compelling villain yet. He does not see himself as the villain. He has a rational motivation for wiping out half the universe, and has the courage of his convictions. He shows humanity, despite being a giant, purple space monster. The ending, however, did not resonate as much as it should have. With half the MCU heroes being wiped out (though none of the ones who signed a four-film contract and leaving only about 70 Avengers for the next film), the audience should have been devastated. But since these films are so tonally light and cartoonish, the stakes don't feel all that high.\", 'Feb 08, 2022', 5.0], ['Jose R', 'Thanos is so epic, I love him.', 'Feb 07, 2022', 5.0], ['Simon', 'Brought the entire set of Marvel movies made over the past decade to a climax, especially with the cliffhanger ending, it reminded me of the ending to Star Wars \"Empire Strikes Back\" and left you waiting for Endgame.', 'Feb 06, 2022', 5.0], ['Luke N', \"The MCU movie that made me really emotional!

The movie is, quite simply, a 21st century masterpiece, probably the best hero movie after its sequel. The biggest highlight is its script, which managed to bring together several characters and built a VERY intriguing story, and its visual and general direction, which is impeccable. Not only that, but the adventure and action are perfect, especially with the good acting. Another extremely positive point is that, even though the film is long, there is not a moment when you disconnect, as the jokes are balanced, the dialogues are not tiring and the story is captivating. The film is an explosion of emotions, especially for fans. Honestly, I dont see any major downsides in the film. Everything fits perfectly.

Very touching.', 'Jan 25, 2022', 4.5], ['K C', \"This film was so highly anticipated that it seems like the creators felt like failure was impossible, and so over hyped after-the-fact that nobody wants to point out the obvious flaws. Now, if I decided to delve into every issue I had with the film, we'd be here all day, so I'll focus on my biggest gripes. These two things are crucial to get right if you want to make a quality film, especially a superhero film and ESPECIALLY one this ambitious. You can't sacrifice the basics. The script, and the villain. The script was cringe worthy from the very beginning. You could tell the actors were doing their best with what they were given, but unfortunately their efforts couldn't salvage it. Many lines and scenes felt superfluous and doused in gravitas without any substance to speak of, leaving me wondering if I was missing something. It seems like it would be difficult to make your characters sound like they're being over dramatic when the stakes are half the lives in the universe, but somehow this script succeeds. However, my absolute biggest gripe of the film was the flimsy, unsympathetic, one-dimensional and frustratingly melodramatic villain, Thanos. Now, I know for a fact that Marvel knows how to write a quality villain. You've got sympathetic characters that, under certain circumstances, you may actually find yourself rooting for like Helmut Zemo, Eric Killmonger, Ava Starr and (more recently) Black Widow's adaptation of Taskmaster. There are charismatic, campy villains that sacrifice relatability for entertainment value like Hela, Mysterio and (more recently) Agatha Harkness. There are tragic villains that compellingly surrendered to the lemons life gave them like Loki and (more recently) Wenwu. Even most of Marvel's villains who are just straight-up psychopaths have a fleshed-out motivation, like a lust for power or money (Ulysses Klau), revenge (Aldrich Killian, Ivan Vanko), or zealotry (Ronan, Kaecilius) to support and strengthen their character Thanos has exactly none of those things. Maybe he'd be sympathetic if we knew more about him, but we don't. He's not charismatic, tragic or relatable. As a matter of fact, he has no clear motivation for his actions whatsoever, making the melodrama of his speech pattern unearned, incredibly grating and frankly hard to watch. I have no idea what gets him out of bed in the morning or what happened in his life to get him to this point. Maybe he's more fleshed out in the comic books, but if your movie has required reading in order to enjoy it, I'm sorry, you're doing something wrong. This conundrum is further emphasized by the fact that his end goal doesn't make sense, and there are about a million alternative solutions available to the wielder of the infinity gauntlet to the problem of overpopulation that don't include genociding half of all life, yet he seems stuck on it for absolutely no reason. A good superhero movie is made or broken by the quality of the villain, and the whiny, superficial antagonist here was incredibly immersion-breaking. I didn't believe him. To me, he felt like nothing more than an overpowered, psychopathic, petulant child. Overall, I have to say, I expected a lot more from Marvel. The plot felt rushed and the interactions of the characters that don't typically interact felt clunky, lazily written, and at times felt like entirely different characters than the ones I've come to love.

Basically every big actor in the MCU (with the exception of a few) is in this movie, making it a true culmination movie and appropriately so as its release year of 2018 marks 10 years of the MCU. Considering how many actors are in this movie, it manages to not squander any of them and give many of them moments to shine and funny lines. The movie has some of the most hilarious one-liners of the whole MCU, and is sure to give viewers a lot of laughs along the way. The film also raises the stakes to the highest they've been in any Marvel movie ever, which grips people with anxiety and doubt the whole way through and never lets them go. The action hits and rises above the standard set by its two predecessors by giving us fight sequences with a much bigger scale than anything seen in the previous two Avengers movies. Thanos is a much better villain than Ultron was because while his execution of his goals isn't great, his goals themselves aren't necessarily bad, giving us a villain who is multidimensional and complex and actually dealing with real world problems. This calls into question the meaning behind the Avengers conflict with him and whether or not there were other methods by which the conflict could've been resolved or Thanos could've achieved his goals. But even more, Thanos is an incredibly powerful being and one who could actually achieve his goals despite having to face the Avengers, which differentiates him from other compelling MCU villains. He is a threat that the Avengers haven't had to deal with so far and are not fully prepared for. Thanos manages to achieve his goals at the end, making him only the second in the MCU to do so and remain alive, Zemo being the previous one. This makes Infinity War's end truly emotional for fans of the characters and the characters themselves and creates a huge cliffhanger for its sequel. While there are certainly things Infinity War could done a better job of addressing, the movie redeems the Avengers franchise from Age of Ultron and should leave viewers satisfied yet wanting more as the credits roll.\", 'Jul 23, 2021', 4.5], ['Nathan G', 'The perfect Marvel Movie.

Any attempt to reason with him would obviously fall on deaf ears as he's also in this to wield the power that will allow him to execute the 'command' (snapping of his fingers with the gauntlet) that will reduce the universal population by 50%.

Before that I wasn\\'t very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn\\'t put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy \"loses\" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it\\'s just \"now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day\". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different. The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It\\'s not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor\\'s hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man\\'s team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America\\'s team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously. Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he\\'s just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don\\'t hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don\\'t matter to him anymore. His ambition does. Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies. And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won\\'t be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven\\'t seen it yet, don\\'t just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear. Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don\\'t like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon\\'s credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today\\'s standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It\\'s the best MCU movie of all time.', 'Apr 21, 2021', 4.5], ['Lasse L', 'A truly hype culmination of a lot of buildup. Thanos stands out as a very strong and memorable character.

Because they took the time to build the characters and worlds they inhabit over 10 years and 18 … freaking … movies. The first Avengers movie impressed me mostly because of the fantastic job Joss Whedon (🤮 ) did in bringing six larger than life characters together with the requisite tension and witty dialogue, while delivering non-stop action. What the Russo brothers were able to achieve in Infinity War is frankly astounding. They did what the first Avengers movie did but with 21 of the main heroes which includes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Falcon, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, and Nick Fury. This doesn\\'t include the excellent supporting characters of Wong, Heimdall, Okoye, Shuri, M\\'Baku, Eitiri, and Maria Hill. Every scene that brings these characters together, especially those that haven\\'t met each other before (Iron Man and Doctor Strange, Thor and Star Lord, etc.), or those that haven\\'t seen each other in a while (Captain America and Winter Soldier), gave me goosebumps. All the personalities from their respective films are the same (Drax is still hilarious: \"Die blanket of death!\" after getting smothered by Doctor Strange\\'s cape). Thanos is probably the best villain in the MCU, toppling Loki. Josh Brolin does a great job making him a brutal and mildly sympathetic villain. And the number of locations they bring us to in all of its (4K HDR) glory is just insane: Earth (New York, Wakanda, etc.), Knowhere (Reality Stone), Vormir (Soul Stone), Zen-Whobiri (Gamora\\'s home planet), Titan (Thanos\\' home planet), and Nidavellir (dwarven \"smith\" planet). 100% of the credit can\\'t be given to the Russo\\'s. The writing, producing, special effects, and frankly all the teams involved deserve huge kudos. The finale is essentially the last hour of the film. While it helps to have a $350-$400 million budget, it takes a perfect storm of all these teams working to pull it off. Multi-location action and drama. And the bitter ending after the snap. What really got to me here was T\\'Challa/Black Panther reaching out to Okoye and says \"This is no place to die\" then turns to dust. With Chadwick Boseman\\'s passing that scene is just too real.
